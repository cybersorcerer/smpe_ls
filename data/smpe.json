The following considerations relate to the FMID operand:\n\n- Unlike prerequisites specified by the PRE operand, the functional prerequisite specified by the FMID operand is satisfied only by the specified SYSMOD. It is not satisfied by another SYSMOD that supersedes that function.\n\n- When specified on the ++VER MCS for a function, FMID defines the function as a dependent function. In this case, FMID indicates that the elements supplied by the dependent function SYSMOD are functionally higher than the specified base function.\n\n- A function cannot be both a base function and a dependent function. Therefore, if a base function contains more than one ++VER MCS, none of them can specify the FMID operand. Likewise, if a dependent function contains more than one ++VER MCS, all of them must specify the FMID operand.\n\n- When specified on the ++VER MCS for a non-function SYSMOD, FMID indicates the functional level of all elements in the SYSMOD. SMP/E RECEIVE processing does not receive a dependent function unless the FMID of the base is already present in the global zone or BYPASS(FMID) is specified"
